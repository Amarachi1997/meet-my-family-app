Meet My Family App
I recently left home and started learning a lot about modern javascript. 
I miss my siblings so much that I started talking about them to myself like I was doing an interview.
I decided to not be a crazy woman but instead, write about them and better still, 
let other people get a chance to know more about my family.
So, I made each child of my parents including myself an object and easily 
available for anyone to look us up just by typing our postion in the family.

Tools:
Javascrit ES6
HTML
CSS & Materialize framework

A class constructor was used to manually create each child object. 
This object contained properties fitting for a child. We have the name, age, 
favourite colour, worst colour and the child's favourite parent as properties for each child.
I then created a function that is triggered when a child is selected and
that child object becomes the parameter passed into that function.

Using an input field as the fetcher, I was able to collect the child's position 
any user was looking for. Then I tested this value (collected from the user) against every childs object usimg a switch statement.
This way, the right child is rendered to the user when upon ther request.
